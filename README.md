# Video Database for AR experiment

created by Kaleb Guo 

## Video captures folder Doc purpose:

In this project, we have a list of video trials from You-jin and Radha’s Augmented reality experiments.  In order to maintain a well-organized experiment datasets. We need to achieve the following things.

- [x]  Convert all the files from H264 to mp4 for easy use.
- [ ]  Inspect each videos folder to correctly label each videos(store in Translate)
    - [x]  Folders:10-20- Finished
    - [x]  Folders:20-30- Finished
    - [x]  Folders:30-40- Finished
    - [ ]  Folders:40-50- In progress; missing sj41-44
    - [ ]  Folders:50-60 -Not stated
- [ ]  Translate each correctly label videos to Individual video trials
    - [ ]  Folders:10-20- In progress missing sj 13-sj18
    - [ ]  Folders:20-30- In progress
    - [ ]  Folders:30-40- In progress
    - [ ]  Folders:40-50- In progress; missing sj41-44
    - [ ]  Folders:50-60 -Not stated
- [ ]  Create a easy approach for other

## Maintenance Approach：

This project will store in 3 folders, and one Excel sheet to main. (Ps. later to posted in Google Drive)The linked will be provided in the flowing context.

1. Translate : this folder will contain all the correctly label videos from the zip file. The purpose of this folder is easy for other people to inspect the original video source files. NOTE: this folders contains unclear trials and broken videos. 
2. Good Source: this folder will contain complete experiments trials as a single video files. Note: The Excel form will be used to keep track of the timestamp need to sperate each experiment for files this folder.
3. Labeled trials: final product. It should contain individual trials for each experiment, separate by the Click Board.
