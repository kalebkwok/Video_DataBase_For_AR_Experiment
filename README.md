# Video Database for AR experiment

created by Kaleb Guo 

## Video captures folder Doc purpose:

We have a list of video trials from You-jin and Radha's Augmented reality experiments in this project. I created this document to track the current process in order to maintain a well-organized experiment dataset.


In general, we need to accomplish the following.

- [x]  Convert all the files from H264 to mp4 for easy use.
- [x]  Inspect each videos folder to correctly label each videos(store in Translate)
    - [x]  Folders:10-20- Finished
    - [x]  Folders:20-30- Finished
    - [x]  Folders:30-40- Finished
    - [x]  Folders:40-50- Finished
    - [x]  Folders:50-60 -Finished
- [x]  Translate each correctly label videos to Individual video trials
    - [x]  Folders:10-20- Finished
    - [x]  Folders:20-30- Finished
    - [x]  Folders:30-40- Finished
    - [x]  Folders:40-50- Finished
    - [x]  Folders:50-60 Finished
- [x]  Create a easy approach for other

## Maintenance Approachï¼š


This project will be organized into three folders, with one Excel sheet serving as a supplementary document.(Note: this will be posted in Google Drive later.) 

Link: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cUOSANnwRxO-NscF74iSlX-hQBzlsaEd](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cUOSANnwRxO-NscF74iSlX-hQBzlsaEd)

1. Translate: This folder will contain all of the videos from the zip file that have been properly labeled. The goal of this folder is to make it simple for others to inspect the original video source files.  NOTE: This folder contains illegible trials and broken videos.
2. Excellent Source: This folder will contain complete experiment trials as a single video file.NOTE: the Excel form will be used to keep track of the timestamps required to sperate each experiment for files in this folder.
3. Trials with labels: final product Individual trials for each experiment should be separated by the Click Board.
